# Gender & Sexuality — Chapter 10

> **In this chapter:** [[Sex vs Gender|Sex ≠ Gender]], [[Gender stereotypes]] & [[Gender roles]], similarities/differences, development, sociocultural & biological theories, [[Intersex]], [[Transgender]], third genders, [[Human sexual response cycle]], and [[Sexual orientation]].

---

## Clarifying terms

- **[[Sex vs Gender|Sex]]**: biological aspects ([[Chromosome|chromosomes]], [[Gonad|gonads]], [[Anatomy|anatomy]]).
    
- **[[Sex vs Gender|Gender]]**: psychological, social, cultural aspects of [[Masculinity|masculinity]]/[[Femininity|femininity]].
    

---

## [[Gender stereotypes]] & [[Gender roles]]

- **Gender-role stereotypes**: beliefs/expectations about traits & behaviors (e.g., “men: aggressive/decisive” vs “women: nurturing/patient”); often inaccurate; U.S. female stereotype historically viewed more positively.
    
- **[[Benevolent sexism]]** can appear “positive” yet reinforces inequality; some stereotype shifts toward perceived equality in many domains.
    

---

## Similarities & differences

> **Key theme:** Across [[Social psychology|social]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] domains, **men and women are more similar than different** on average; differences are **means**, not absolutes. Finding a difference ≠ identifying its **cause**.

### Personality & emotion

- No broad average personality gap; consistent patterns: men (↑ assertive/thing-oriented), women (↑ people-oriented/socially sensitive).
    
- Emotional **experience** is similar; **expression** varies with cultural [[Display rules]].
    
- **[[Toxic masculinity]]**: rigid adherence to narrow norms can harm men and others; [[American Psychological Association|APA]] highlights healthier, prosocial masculine roles (e.g., engaged fathering).
    

### Cognition & [[STEM]]

- Most cognitive abilities show **no reliable sex differences**; historical gaps (verbal/spatial/math) have **narrowed**.
    
- Under-representation of women in **STEM** linked to [[Discrimination]] and **[[Implicit bias]]**; solutions target climates, supports, and evaluation practices.

## [[Gender development]]

- **18–21 mo**: gender labels & early behavior differences.
    
- **Age 2–3**: identify [[Gender identity|self/others]]; adopt stereotypes for toys/clothes/roles; preference for same-gender toys from ~**3** onward.
    
- **5–10**: stronger stereotypes about “men’s vs women’s jobs.”
    
- Children are **more rigid** than adults; boys show **more rigidity** in toys/attitudes; girls often become **more flexible** with age.

## Why gendered behavior develops: major accounts

- **[[Social learning theory]]**: reinforcement/punishment/modeling shape gendered behavior.
    
- **[[Gender schema theory]]** (Sandra Bem): children build & use schemas of “boy/girl”; mere labels shift memory/behavior.
    
- **[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary accounts]]**: some differences reflect adaptive pressures.
    
- **Interactionist**: sociocultural **+** biological factors combine.

## Beyond binary categories

### [[Intersex]]

- Biological sex **ambiguous** ([[Chromosomes|chromosomes]]/[[Anatomy|anatomy]]/[[Physiology|physiology]] combos).
    
- Not inherently pathological; advocates (e.g., [[interACT]]) oppose non-essential infant surgeries.
    

### [[Transgender]]

- **[[Gender identity]]** conflicts with sex assigned at birth. Terms: **[[Transgender man]]**, **[[Transgender woman]]**, **[[Cisgender]]**; some are **[[Nonbinary]]** and use they/them.
    
- Etiology remains under study (possible biological/[[Brain|brain]] factors).
    

### [[Third gender]]

- Cultures vary in gender flexibility: **[[Zulu]]** practices, **Muxes** (Zapotec, Mexico), **Hijra** (India); see **[[Yogyakarta Principles]]**.
    

---

## [[Human sexual response cycle]]

- **[[Masters and Johnson|Masters & Johnson]]** mapped four stages: **[[Sexual arousal|excitement]] → [[Plateau phase|plateau]] → [[Orgasm]] → [[Resolution (sex)|resolution]]**.
    
- Sexual activity continues into later life for many married/cohabiting heterosexual couples and many lesbian/gay adults.
    
- In humans, sexual behavior is **not limited** to fertile periods and is shaped by learning/environment; [[Bonobo|bonobos]] illustrate sociosexual flexibility.
    

---

## [[Sexual orientation]]

- Patterns of [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]] may be to a different sex, same sex, both, or neither; [[Identity (social science)|identity]], desires, and behaviors don’t always align perfectly.
    
- Terms include **[[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]**, **[[Gay]]/[[Lesbian]]**, **[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]**, **[[Asexuality|asexual]]**, **[[Allosexual]]**; **bisexuality among women** has increased in surveys.
    
- **Not a disorder**: removed from [[DSM]] in **1973**; major orgs ([[American Psychological Association|APA]], [[World Psychiatric Association|WPA]]) reject “[[Conversion therapy|conversion]]” efforts due to lack of evidence and potential harm; **[[Sexual fluidity]]** occurs naturally.
    

> [!warning] Mental health & safety  
> [[LGBTQ]] students report higher rates of [[Depression]] and [[Bullying]]/[[Victimization]]; U.S. [[Violence|violence]] against LGBTQ people has **increased** in recent years, though acceptance is **rising** globally.
