## [[Slideshows/Week 4 (Learning)/Learning]] — What is it?

- **Definition:** a relatively **enduring change** in [[Behavior|behavior]] or [[Thinking|thinking]] that results from **[[Experience|experience]]**.
    
- [[Habituation]]: reduced responding after repeated exposure to a stimulus.
    
- [[Stimulus]]: event that tends to elicit a response.
    

---

## [[Classical conditioning]]

- **Core idea:** two **[[Stimulus|stimuli]]** become associated. A previously **[[Neutral stimulus|neutral stimulus (NS)]]** becomes a **[[Conditioned stimulus|conditioned stimulus (CS)]]** that elicits a **[[Conditioned response|conditioned response (CR)]]** after pairing with an **[[Unconditioned stimulus|unconditioned stimulus (US)]]** that evokes an **[[Unconditioned response|unconditioned response (UR)]]**.
    

### Vocabulary at a glance

- **[[Unconditioned stimulus|US]]:** triggers an involuntary response **without learning**.
    
- **[[Unconditioned response|UR]]:** the reflexive, involuntary response to the US.
    
- **[[Conditioned stimulus|CS]]:** was neutral, now elicits a response after learning.
    
- **[[Conditioned response|CR]]:** learned response to the CS.
    
- **[[Acquisition (classical conditioning)|Acquisition]]:** initial learning phase (pairings of CS→US).
    

### Generalization, Discrimination, Extinction

- **[[Stimulus generalization]]:** respond to stimuli **similar** to the CS.
    
- **[[Stimulus discrimination]]:** learn to respond **only** to the CS, not similar ones.
    
- **[[Extinction]]:** CR decreases when CS is repeatedly presented **without** the US.
    
- **[[Spontaneous recovery]]:** CR reappears after extinction.
    

### Extensions & Applications

- **[[Higher-order conditioning]]:** a new neutral stimulus becomes a CS by pairing with an existing CS.
    
- **[[Conditioned taste aversion]]:** associating a taste with illness; has **[[Adaptive value]]** (e.g., wildlife management with invasive [[Cane toad]]s & [[Goanna]]s).
    
- **Prepared fears & cognition:** humans can form conditioned fears using **[[Language|verbal information]]** alone; [[Amygdala]] activation resembles standard fear conditioning (see [[Elizabeth Phelps]] work).
    
- **[[Little Albert]]:** CS = white rat; US = loud noise; CR/UR = fear; shows **[[Stimulus generalization|generalization]]**.
    
- **[[Advertising]]:** pair emotion-evoking imagery with neutral products to condition positive responses.

> Pavlov’s dogs revealed learned salivation to tones; Watson reframed psychology as the **science of [[Observable behavior|observable behavior]]** and applied conditioning widely.

## [[Operant conditioning]]

- **Core idea:** [[Behavior|behaviors]] become more/less likely based on their **[[Consequence|consequences]]**.
    
- **[[Edward Thorndike]]’s [[Law of effect]]:** satisfying consequences **strengthen** responses; dissatisfying ones **weaken** them.
    
- **[[B. F. Skinner]]:** environment shapes thoughts, emotions, behaviors.
    

### Reinforcement basics

- **[[Reinforcer]]:** event/stimulus that **increases** behavior.
    
- **[[Reinforcement]]:** the process of increasing behavior via consequences.
    
- **[[Positive reinforcement]]:** **add** a desirable stimulus after behavior.
    
- **[[Negative reinforcement]]:** **remove** an unpleasant stimulus after behavior.
    

> [!example] [[Social media]] as reinforcement  
> “Likes” and notifications engage reward circuits (e.g., [[Nucleus accumbens]]), increasing posting behavior—akin to operant reinforcement.

### Shaping & Biological limits

- **[[Shaping]] / [[Successive approximations]]:** reinforce small steps toward a target behavior.
    
- **Limits:** **[[Instinctive drift]]** can pull trained behaviors back toward species-typical actions.
    

### Schedules of reinforcement

- **[[Continuous reinforcement]]:** every response reinforced (best for **[[Acquisition (operant conditioning)|acquisition]]**).
    
- **[[Partial reinforcement]]:** responses reinforced **intermittently** (best for **maintenance**).
    
- **[[Partial reinforcement effect]]:** intermittent schedules → **more resistant** to [[Extinction]].
    
- **[[Schedules of reinforcement|Schedules]]:** [[Fixed-ratio]], [[Variable-ratio]], [[Fixed-interval]], [[Variable-interval]].
    

### [[Punishment]]

- Can suppress behavior but with risks/side effects.
    
- **Evidence snapshot:** a large [[Meta-analysis|meta-analysis]] linked **[[Spanking|spanking]]** with numerous negative outcomes (e.g., ↑ aggression, mental health problems, ↓ self-esteem); even studies finding small effects don’t show **benefits** of spanking.
    

### [[Learned helplessness]]

- When expectations of failure build, organisms may **quit** even when escape or success becomes possible.
    

---

## [[Observational learning]]

- **Key theme:** we learn by **watching and [[Imitation|imitating]]** others ([[Model (psychology)|models]]).
    
- **[[Albert Bandura]]:** demonstrated that **expectations of [[Reinforcement|reinforcement]]** (seeing others rewarded) can reinforce our own behavior (e.g., **[[Bobo doll experiment|Bobo doll]]** studies).
    

### Media & aggression

- An [[American Psychological Association|APA]] task force (2017) statement: violent video game use is associated with **increases** in several aggression-related outcomes and **decreases** in [[Empathy|empathy]]; media violence is **one** of many contributing variables.
    

### Prosocial modeling

- Exposure to **[[Prosocial behavior|prosocial]] models** (e.g., educational TV, prosocial lyrics) can foster **[[Helping behavior|helping]]** and kindness in children and adults.
    

### What boosts imitation?

You’re more likely to imitate:

- Models who are **[[Reinforcement|rewarded]]**, **warm/nurturing**, **powerful**, **high-status**, or **similar** to you.
    
- When tasks are of **moderate difficulty**, you **lack [[Self-efficacy|confidence]]**, the situation is **[[Ambiguity|ambiguous]]**, or you’ve been **[[Reinforcement history|rewarded]]** for imitating before.
    

### [[Mirror neuron]]s

- Neurons that fire when performing an act **and** when **observing** the same act; may underlie [[Imitation|imitation]], [[Empathy|empathy]], and aspects of observational learning.

## Cognitive views on learning

### [[Latent learning]]

- Learning can occur **without awareness** and **without reinforcement**; it may not show until needed (e.g., [[Edward Tolman]]’s maze rats).
    

### [[Cognitive map|Cognitive maps]]

- Mental representations of physical space; supported by **[[Place cell|place]]** and **[[Grid cell|grid]]** cells; allow navigation without continuous reinforcement.

## Myth check: [[Learning styles]]

- People have **preferences** and differing abilities, but evidence **does not** support that teaching strictly to a preferred “style” improves learning outcomes.
