# Thinking, Language, and Intelligence — Chapter 7

> **In this chapter:** [[Cognition|What is cognition?]], [[Problem solving]] & [[Decision-making]], [[Language]] (structure, development, thought), [[Measuring intelligence]] & [[Nature of intelligence]], genes ✕ environment, [[Stereotype threat]].

---

## [[Cognition]]

- **Cognition:** mental activities involved in acquiring, retaining, and using [[Knowledge|knowledge]].
    
- **Thinking:** manipulating **[[Mental representation|mental representations]]** to draw inferences/make conclusions → two building blocks: **[[Mental image|mental images]]** and **[[Concept]]s**. Same [[Brain|brain]] areas activate when we **see** vs **imagine** faces/places ([[Fusiform face area|FFA]]/[[Parahippocampal place area|PPA]]).
    

### [[Prototype]]s & Category Judgments

- Faster identification when an item closely matches a category **[[Prototype]]**.
    

---

## [[Problem solving]]

- **[[Goal-directed behavior|Goal-directed]]** thinking when the answer isn’t readily available.
    
- Strategies: **[[Trial and error]]**, **[[Algorithm]]s** (guaranteed), **[[Heuristic]]s** (rules of thumb), **[[Insight]]** (sudden reorganization).
    
- **[[Functional fixedness]]**: tendency to think of objects only in usual functions; blocks [[Creativity|creative]] solutions.
    

---

## [[Decision-making]]

- We adapt strategies to the **type/number** of options.
    
- **Under [[Uncertainty|uncertainty]]:** we estimate probabilities with heuristics:
    
    - **[[Availability heuristic]]** – judge likelihood by ease of recall (often from [[Long-term memory|LTM]]).
        
    - **[[Representativeness heuristic]]** – judge by similarity to a prototype; can ignore [[Base rate|base rates]].
        

### [[Cognitive bias|Persistence of unwarranted beliefs]]

- **[[Belief bias|Belief-bias effect]]**, **[[Confirmation bias]]**, **[[Illusory correlation|Fallacy of positive instances]]**, **[[Overconfidence effect|Overestimation effect]]**; apply **[[Critical thinking]]** to counteract.
    

---

## [[Language]]

- System of **arbitrary [[Symbol|symbols]]** + [[Grammar|rules]] to produce infinite meaningful statements; supports **[[Displacement]]** (talk about non-present things); [[Productivity (language)|creative/generative]].
    

### Language & Brain

- **[[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]]** meets all criteria for language ([[Syntax|syntax]], [[Displacement]], [[Productivity (language)|generativity]]); **similar [[Brain|brain regions]]** activate in fluent signers vs speakers.
    

### [[Linguistic relativity hypothesis|Language ↔ Thought]]

- Strong **[[Determinism|determinism]]** not supported; contemporary view: **[[Bidirectional causation|bidirectional influence]]** shaped by [[Culture|culture]] (e.g., [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]] number terms).
    

---

## [[Language development]]

- **[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]:** innate predisposition to learn any language.
    
- **[[Infant-directed speech]]** is universal (simplified vocab, short sentences, higher pitch, exaggerated intonation), even in signed languages.
    
- **[[Comprehension vocabulary]]** grows **>2×** faster than **[[Production vocabulary]]**.
    
- Stages: **[[Cooing]]** (~3 mo) → **[[Babbling]]** (~5 mo) → **[[Holophrase|One-word]]** (~12 mo) → **[[Telegraphic speech|Two-word]]** (~2 yrs) → **[[Vocabulary spurt|Language spurt]]** (~2½ yrs).
    
- Decline in _new_ language-learning ease around **6–7 yrs** (see [[Critical period hypothesis|critical period]]).
    

### [[Bilingualism]]

- With balanced proficiency: better **[[Attentional control]]**, **[[Task switching|task switching]]**, **[[Perspective-taking|perspective taking]]**, and **[[Cognitive reserve]]** against late-life decline.
    

### [[Animal cognition]] & Communication

- Animals show learning/memory/thinking; some (bonobos, dolphins, parrots) follow spoken commands but far below human language.
    
- **[[Prairie dog]]s** encode predator **type/size/speed** in calls.
    
- [[Dog cognition|Dogs]] show notable sensitivity to **human actions**.

## [[Measuring intelligence]]

- **Definition:** global capacity to think **[[Rationality|rationally]]**, act **[[Purposeful behavior|purposefully]]**, and deal **effectively** with the environment.
    

### Historical milestones

- **[[Alfred Binet]]**: tests of elementary mental abilities; **[[Mental age]]** to flag students needing help.
    
- **[[Lewis Terman]]**: [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford–Binet]]; coined **[[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]** (mental age/chronological age × 100).
    
- **[[David Wechsler]]**: [[WAIS]] (adults), later [[WISC]]/[[WPPSI]]; multiple subtests (verbal/performance), **[[Norm-referenced test|age-normed]]** scoring vs ratio IQ.
    

### Principles of test construction

- **[[Achievement test]]** vs **[[Aptitude test]]**.
    
- **[[Standardization]]** (norms; [[Normal distribution|normal curve]]), **[[Reliability]]** (consistency), **[[Validity]]** (measures what it intends).
    

---

## [[Nature of intelligence]]

- Ongoing debate: single **general ability** vs multiple abilities/skills.
    
- **[[G factor|g factor]]** ([[Charles Spearman|Spearman]]): single general intelligence underlying diverse tests (“mental energy”).
    
- **[[Multiple intelligences]] (Gardner)**: eight independent abilities valued across cultures (popular; research support limited).
    
- **[[Triarchic theory of intelligence]] (Sternberg)**: **Analytic**, **Creative**, **Practical** (“successful intelligence”).
    
- **Both-and** views (general + specific abilities) are common.
    

---

## Extremes & Influences

- **[[Intellectual disability]]:** deficits that impair independent functioning.
    
- **[[Giftedness]]:** IQ ≥ 130 with exceptional abilities; [[Leta Hollingworth]] emphasized roles of **[[Education]]** and **[[Environment (psychology)|environment]]** (not just genetics).
    

### Genes ✕ Environment

- Gene **[[Gene expression|expression]]** is shaped by environment.
    
- **[[Twin study|Twin studies]]**: [[Monozygotic twins|identical]] twins share all genes; differences reflect environment; [[Dizygotic twins|fraternal]] twins like ordinary siblings.
    
- **[[Flynn effect]]**: generational **rise** in average IQ across ~30 nations ⇒ environmental change implicated.
    

### [[Stereotype threat]]

- Fear of confirming a negative group stereotype → **[[Stress|stress]]/**[[Self-doubt|self-doubt]], **[[Physiological arousal|physiological arousal]]**, **distracting thoughts** that impair [[Attention|attention]], [[Memory|memory]], [[Problem solving|problem solving]] → lower test performance.
