## [[What Is Psychology]]

- **Definition:** the _science of [[Behavior|behavior]] and [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Mental processes|mental processes]]_. [[Behavior]]; [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Mental processes]].
    
- **Scope:** from single [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Neuron|nerve cells]] to crowds and [[Culture|cultures]].
    
- **Goals:** **Describe**, **predict**, **explain**, **control/change** [[Behavior|behavior]] and [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Mental processes|mental processes]].
    

### Origins: Philosophy + Physiology

- [[Aristotle]] → [[Dreams|dreams]], [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Sleep|sleep]], [[Sensation and perception|senses]], [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Memory|memory]].
    
- [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) → **[[Mind–body dualism|mind–body dualism]]**; [[Intuition|intuition]]/[[Observation|observation]]/[[Logic|logic]]; early roots of [[Nature–nurture debate|nature–nurture]].
    
- Growing 1800s [[Physiology]] → scientific methods applied to [[Mind|mind]].
    

### Founders & Early Schools

- [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832–1920) → _Principles of Physiological Psychology_ (1874); **first psych lab** (Leipzig, 1879).
    
- [[Edward B. Titchener]] → **[[Structuralism]]** ([[Introspection|introspection]]; basic components of [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Consciousness|consciousness]]).
    
- [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/William James]] → **[[Functionalism]]** (purpose of [[Behavior|behavior]]/[[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Consciousness|consciousness]]; influenced by [[Charles Darwin]] & [[Adaptation|adaptation]]).
    
- [[Sigmund Freud]] → **[[Psychoanalysis]]** ([[Unconscious|unconscious]] conflicts; [[Personality|personality]] theory & [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapy]]).
    

### Behaviorism → Observable Behavior

- [[Behaviorism]]: study **overt** [[Behavior|behavior]]; [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Learning|learning]].
    
- [[B. F. Skinner]] → [[Reinforcement]] & [[Punishment]]; [[Animal research|animal experiments]] shaping [[Behavior|behavior]].
    

### Humanistic Psychology

- [[Carl Rogers]]: [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Consciousness|conscious]] experience, [[Personal growth|growth]], [[Self-direction|self-direction]], [[Free will|free will]], [[Choice|choice]].
    
- [[Abraham Maslow]]: [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Motivation]] & psychological growth (needs, [[Self-actualization|self-actualization]]).

## [[Contemporary Psychology|Contemporary Psychology (Perspectives)]]

Psychologists often identify by:

1. their **perspective** on psychological topics, and
    
2. their **specialty area** of practice/training.
    

### Major Perspectives

- [[Biological Perspective]]: [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Nervous system|nervous]], [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Immune system|immune]], [[Genetics|genetics]]; see also [[Neuroscience]].
    
- [[Psychodynamic Perspective]]: [[Unconscious processes|unconscious processes]]; early experience; interpersonal relationships (Freud-inspired, modernized).
    
- [[Behavioral Perspective]]: [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Learning|learning]] principles; environment/experience; applications to [[Behavior therapy|treatment]].
    
- [[Humanistic Perspective]]: growth, relationships, [[Self-concept|self-concept]], [[Choice|choice]]/[[Self-direction|self-direction]] (often in mental health).
    
- [[Positive Psychology]]: positive emotions/states, traits, and institutions (happiness, optimism, creativity, resilience, strengths, wisdom; therapeutic techniques).
    
- [[Cognitive Perspective]]: mental processes ([[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Attention|attention]], [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Memory|memory]], [[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Language|language]], [[Problem solving|problem-solving]]).
    
- [[Cross-Cultural Perspective]]: [[Culture|culture]]’s role in [[Behavior|behavior]]/[[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Mental processes|mental processes]].
    
- [[Evolutionary Perspective]]: [[Natural selection|natural selection]] shapes psychological processes; heritable differences aid survival/[[Adaptation|adaptation]].
    

### Specialty Areas

- [[Clinical psychology]] / [[Counseling psychology]]: diagnosis, treatment, causes, prevention of disorders (Ph.D./Psy.D.; many regions use M.S.).
    
- [[Psychiatry]]: medical specialty (M.D./D.O.) for mental & behavioral disorders.

## [[Scientific method]]

A set of assumptions, attitudes, and procedures guiding how researchers **ask questions**, **generate evidence**, and **draw conclusions**.  
Researchers assume events are **lawful** and **explainable**; they practice open-minded **[[Scientific skepticism|scientific skepticism]]**.

### Core Steps

1. **Formulate** testable [[Questions|questions]]/[[Hypothesis|hypotheses]].
    
2. **Design** the study (choose method/[[Control group|controls]]).
    
3. **Analyze data & draw conclusions** (use [[Statistics|statistics]]).
    
4. **Report findings** (detailed method, **[[Open science]]**, [[Replication|replication]]; note the **[[Replication crisis]]**).

## [[Descriptive research]]

Systematic observation & description of [[Behavior|behavior]].  
**Designs:** [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] and [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]].

**Methods**

- [[Naturalistic observation]]
    
- [[Case study]]
    
- [[Survey research]]
    
- [[Correlation]]/**Correlational methods**
    

> [!warning] Correlation ≠ Causation  
> Even strong correlations **do not** imply [[Cause and effect|cause–effect]]. Only **[[Experiments|experiments]]** allow causal inference.

**Interpreting correlations**

- **[[Positive correlation|Positive correlation]]:** variables move **together** (↑ with ↑ or ↓ with ↓).
    
- **[[Negative correlation|Negative correlation]]:** variables move in **opposite** directions (↑ with ↓).
    

---

## [[Experimental research]]

**Purpose:** demonstrate **[[Cause and effect|cause–effect]]** by **manipulating** one factor and observing change in another.

**Key variables**

- **[[Independent variable]] (IV):** manipulated predictor.
    
- **[[Dependent variable]] (DV):** measured outcome.
    
- **[[Confounding variable]]:** extraneous factor that can affect results if uncontrolled.
    

**Limitations & Variations**

- Lab conditions may limit **[[Ecological validity|ecological validity]]** / [[Generalizability|generalizability]].
    
- Some manipulations are **impractical or unethical**; consider **[[Natural experiment|natural experiments]]**.
    
- **[[Slideshows/Week 1 (Intro-Research)/Neuroimaging|Brain imaging]]** is increasingly used across subfields.

## [[Research Ethics]]

- Pre-1960s: minimal oversight → emergence of standards.
    
- **[[Belmont Report]] (1976)**: ethical guidelines (response to [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study|Tuskegee, 1932–1969]], [[Nazi human experimentation|Nazi experiments]], [[Milgram experiment|Milgram]] & [[Stanford prison experiment|Zimbardo]]).
    
- Ethical principles in psychology:
    
    - **[[Confidentiality]]**
        
    - **[[Informed consent]]**
        
    - **[[Debriefing]]**
        
    - **Prior approval by an [[Institutional Review Board (IRB)]]** for **all** human/[[Animal research|animal]] studies.
        

> [!tip] Academic Integrity  
> Avoid **[[Plagiarism]]**. Maintain confidentiality and [[Research transparency|transparency]] throughout the research process.
