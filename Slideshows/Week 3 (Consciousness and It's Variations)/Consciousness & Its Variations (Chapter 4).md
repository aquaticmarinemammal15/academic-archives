# Consciousness & Its Variations — Chapter 4

> **In this chapter:** [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Consciousness]], [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Attention]] & [[Multitasking|the perils of multitasking]], [[Circadian rhythms]] & [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Sleep]], [[Dreaming]] (theories), [[Sleep disorders]], and [[Psychoactive drugs]].

## [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Consciousness]]

- **Definition:** personal [[Awareness|awareness]] of [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Mental processes|mental activities]], internal [[Sensation|sensations]], and the external [[Environment|environment]].
    
- [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/William James]] (1892): [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Consciousness|consciousness]] is a **“[[Stream of consciousness|stream]]”** that integrates past, present, and future—supporting continuity of personal identity.

## [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Attention]]: The Mind’s Spotlight

- Focused attention is limited; splitting it (**[[Multitasking]]**) degrades [[Performance|performance]] and [[Safety|safety]].
    

> [!warning] Multitasking ≠ Multi-processing  
> [[Task switching|Switching costs]] and [[Divided attention|divided attention]] reduce accuracy and slow responses, especially in complex tasks.

## Cycles of Consciousness: [[Circadian rhythms]] & [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Sleep]]

- Many body and mental functions vary on a ~24-hour cycle. Intrinsic human rhythm ~**24.2 h**; without [[Zeitgeber|time cues]], rhythms can **[[Circadian desynchrony|desynchronize]]** ([[Sleep–wake cycle|sleep–wake]], temperature, [[Melatonin|melatonin]]). **[[Jet lag]]** fuzzes thinking, concentration, [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Memory|memory]]. [[Blindness|Blind]] individuals may show desynchronized cycles.
    

### Want to Sleep Better?

- Evening **[[Blue light]]** from phones/tablets/laptops ↑ alertness and ↓ [[Melatonin|melatonin]] → delayed sleep, disrupted patterns, next-day sleepiness. Print books before bed outperform [[E-book|light-emitting e-books]] on sleep outcomes. **Turn off the screen.**

## [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Sleep]] Architecture

- **Two basic types:** [[REM sleep]] and [[NREM sleep]]; [[Sleep cycle|stages cycle]] across the night.
    
- **Across the lifespan:** [[Sleep duration|sleep]] ↑ in [[Child development|childhood]]/[[Adolescence|adolescence]], remains fairly stable in [[Adulthood|adulthood]], ↓ in [[Aging|late adulthood]].
    

### Why Do We Sleep?

- **Adaptive/Evolutionary view:** conserve [[Energy|energy]]; avoid hazards at risky times.
    
- **Restorative/Memory view:** strengthens and integrates new [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Memory|memories]] ([[Memory consolidation|consolidation]]); supports [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Immune system|immune function]], [[Emotion regulation|mood regulation]], and clears metabolic waste ([[Glymphatic system]]).
    

### The Sleep-Deprived Emotional Brain

- Heightened reactivity to **negative** stimuli and unrealistic positivity toward **reward**, increasing [[Risk-taking|risky]]/[[Addiction|addictive]] behaviors.
    

---

## Mental Activity During Sleep

- **Sleep thinking:** [[NREM sleep|NREM]] [[Slow-wave sleep|slow-wave]], bland, thought-like ruminations.
    
- **Dreaming:** mostly during **[[REM sleep|REM]]**; ~**90%** [[Dream recall|recall]] if awakened during REM; ~**4–5** episodes/night.
    

### Theories of [[Dreaming]]

- **[[Activation–synthesis model]]:** [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Brainstem|brainstem]] activity triggers cortical synthesis of a coherent story.
    
- **[[Neurocognitive model of dreaming]]:** dreams mirror waking concerns, interests, and personality; similar to normal thought processes.
    

---

## [[Sleep disorders]]

- Defined by **consistent abnormal patterns**, **subjective [[Distress|distress]]**, and **daytime [[Impairment|impairment]]**. Surprisingly common and diverse.
    

### Major Categories

- **[[Insomnia]]**.
    
- **[[Obstructive sleep apnea]]** and **[[Narcolepsy]]**.
    
- **[[Parasomnias]]** (undesired arousals/actions during sleep or transitions; often with amnesia):
    
    - [[Sleep terrors]] • [[Sleepwalking]] • [[Sleep-related eating disorder]] • [[Sexsomnia]] • [[Exploding head syndrome]].
        

---

## [[Psychoactive drugs]]

- Influence [[Brain|brain]] activity by altering **[[Synaptic transmission|synaptic transmission]]**: ↑/↓ [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Neurotransmitter|neurotransmitter]] release, **[[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Reuptake|blocking reuptake]]**, or **mimicking/blocking** transmitter effects. Addictive drugs strongly engage the **[[Dopamine|dopamine]]** [[Reward system|reward system]].
    

### [[Depressants]]

- Depress or inhibit [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Central nervous system|CNS]] activity → drowsiness/sedation/sleep; relieve [[Anxiety|anxiety]] and lower inhibitions; additive when combined; **high abuse potential**.
    
- **[[Alcohol]]**: small doses may reduce tension; implicated in ~**90,000** U.S. deaths annually; over half of assaults, homicides, and motor vehicle accidents; frequent factor in [[Intimate partner violence|domestic/partner violence]], child abuse, sexual assault; leading preventable cause of certain [[Birth defects|birth defects]].
    
- **[[Opioids]]**: from poppy derivatives to synthetics (e.g., [[Meperidine|Demerol]]).
    

### [[Stimulants]]

- **[[Caffeine]]**: found in coffee/tea/cola/chocolate/OTC meds; ↑ wakefulness/alertness/vigilance, ↑ [[Dopamine|dopamine]] in [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal cortex]], **blocks [[Adenosine receptor|adenosine]]**; excess can cause [[Anxiety|anxiety]], restlessness, ↑ heart rate, **disrupt [[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Sleep|sleep]]** and contribute to [[Parasomnias|NREM parasomnias/sleepwalking]].
    
- **[[Cocaine]]**: powerful euphoria/alertness; blocks **[[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Reuptake|reuptake]]** of [[Dopamine|dopamine]], [[Serotonin|serotonin]], [[Norepinephrine|norepinephrine]]; risks vary by route.
    
- **[[Amphetamines]] / [[Methamphetamine]]**: prolonged use can trigger wide-ranging psychological disorders, including **stimulant-induced [[Psychosis|psychosis]]**; meth produces an intense, longer-lasting high, is highly addictive, damages especially **[[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Frontal lobe|frontal lobes]]**; long-term recovery is difficult; [[Depression|depression]], emotional instability, [[Impulsivity|impulsive]]/violent behavior are common.
    

### [[Psychedelic drugs]]

- Produce profound perceptual distortions, [[Mood|mood]], and [[Thinking|thinking]] changes (“**mind-manifesting**”).
    

> [!note] A Different Point of View  
> Some controlled clinical trials suggest **[[LSD]]/[[Psilocybin]]/other [[Psychedelic drugs|psychedelics]]** may help treat [[Anxiety disorders|anxiety]], [[Substance use disorder|substance abuse]], and [[Depression|depression]]; **[[Microdosing]]** is explored for treatment, creativity, or cognition (ongoing/controversial).

### [[Cannabis]] & [[THC]]

- Reported medical uses include **[[Pain|pain]]**, **[[Slideshows/Week 3 (Consciousness and It's Variations)/Epilepsy|epilepsy]]**, **[[Hypertension|hypertension]]**, **[[Nausea|nausea]]/**[[Vomiting|vomiting]] (e.g., chemotherapy), **[[Glaucoma|glaucoma]]**, **[[Asthma|asthma]]**. (Efficacy, dosing, and legal status vary; see jurisdiction-specific guidance.)
