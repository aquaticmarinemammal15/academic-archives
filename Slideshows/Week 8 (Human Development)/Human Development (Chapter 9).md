## [[Developmental psychology|What is developmental psychology?]]

Studies **changes across the [[Lifespan|lifespan]]** in three domains: **[[Physical development|physical]]**, **[[Cognitive development|cognitive]]**, and **[[Social development|social]]**. Some transitions are [[Stage theory|abrupt]], many are [[Continuity|gradual]], and “[[Stage|stages]]” can be defined in multiple ways (age, life transitions, [[Critical period|critical periods]]).

### Studying change: core designs

- **[[Cross-sectional study]]** — compare different ages at one time.
    
- **[[Longitudinal study]]** — follow the same individuals across time.
    
- **[[Cross-sequential design]]** — hybrid to separate [[Age effects|age]], [[Cohort effect|cohort]], and time effects.

## From [[Genotype]] → [[Phenotype]]

- **[[Gene]]:** [[DNA]] unit encoding a [[Protein|protein]]; basic unit of [[Heredity|heredity]].
    
- **[[Genotype]]:** an individual’s genetic makeup.
    
- **[[Phenotype]]:** observable traits from **genes ✕ [[Environment (psychology)|environment]]**.
    

---

## [[Prenatal development]]

- Major stages and sensitivity to **[[Teratogen]]s** (agents causing prenatal harm).
    
- [[Fetal brain development|Fetal brain]] growth is rapid; sets foundations for later behavior and [[Cognition|cognition]].
    

---

## Infancy & Childhood

> **Key theme:** Though physically helpless, newborns arrive with reflexes and tuned senses that support survival and bonding.

### Newborn reflexes

[[Rooting reflex]] • [[Sucking reflex]] • [[Babinski reflex]] • [[Grasp reflex]] • [[Stepping reflex]].

### Newborn senses

- **Vision:** nearsighted; prefer **human faces** at ~**6–12 in** viewing distance. See [[Face perception]].
    
- **Hearing:** hours after birth, prefer **mother’s voice** (and face). See [[Audition]].
    
- **Smell:** by **2 days**, prefer **mother’s scent**. See [[Olfaction]].
    

### Physical & motor development

- [[Brain]] reaches ~**75%** of adult weight in infancy.
    
- **[[Cephalocaudal trend|Cephalocaudal]]** (head→toe) and **[[Proximodistal trend|proximodistal]]** (center→out) motor progressions.
    
- Basic milestone sequence is **[[Universals (development)|universal]]**, but average ages vary.
    

---

## [[Attachment]]

- **[[Harry Harlow|Harlow]] (rhesus monkeys):** deprivation causes severe pathology; all primates seek **[[Contact comfort]]**.
    
- **[[Mary Ainsworth|Ainsworth]]’s [[Strange Situation]]:** observed **mother–infant** separations/reunions and a **friendly stranger** to classify attachment patterns; attachment = early **emotional bond** with caregivers.  
    See also: [[Emotion]] • [[Amygdala]] • [[Social development]] • [[Stranger anxiety]].

## [[Cognitive development]]

### [[Jean Piaget]]: four stages

1. **[[Sensorimotor stage]] (0–2)**: learning via senses/actions; by the end → **[[Object permanence]]**; early months act as if removed objects **cease to exist** (peek-a-boo surprise).
    
2. **[[Preoperational stage]] (2–7)**: **[[Symbolic thought]]** → [[Symbolic play]] & **[[Deferred imitation]]**; limits: **[[Egocentrism]]**, **[[Irreversibility]]**, **[[Centration]]**, fails **[[Conservation]]** (tall glass illusion).
    
3. **[[Concrete operational stage]] (7–12)**: logical operations on **concrete** info; better **[[Classification]]/[[Categorization]]**, less egocentric; still struggle with **[[Abstract thinking|abstract]]/[[Hypothetical thinking|hypothetical]]** reasoning.
    
4. **[[Formal operational stage]] (12+)**: abstract, hypothetical, and [[Scientific reasoning|systematic]] reasoning.
    

> **Piaget strengths:** inspired vast research; established that infants, children, and adults use **qualitatively different** abilities.  
> **Critiques:**  
> • **Underestimates infants’ abilities** (e.g., **[[Renée Baillargeon|Baillargeon]]**).  
> • **Underplays culture/social guidance** → [[Lev Vygotsky]]’s **[[Zone of proximal development (ZPD)]]**.  
> • **Overestimates formal operations** universality; modern **[[Information-processing approach|information-processing]]** approaches add nuance.

## [[Adolescence]]

> Transition from childhood to adulthood marked by sweeping physical, social, and cognitive changes; typically begins ~**11–12**. **[[Sexual maturity]]** is reached; girls usually ~**2 years** ahead of boys in physical maturation.

### Physical & sexual development

- **[[Puberty]]**: capacity for reproduction.
    
- **[[Primary sex characteristics]]:** uterus/ovaries; penis/testes.
    
- **[[Secondary sex characteristics]]:** e.g., female breast development, male facial hair.
    

### Identity & social development

- [[Erik Erikson|Erikson]]: **[[Identity vs. role confusion|identity formation]]** is central (adolescence).

## [[Moral development]] — [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]

- **Level I: [[Preconventional morality|Preconventional]]**
    
    - **Stage 1:** **[[Punishment–obedience]]** (avoid punishment).
        
    - **Stage 2:** **[[Instrumental relativist orientation|Mutual benefit]]** (fair exchange).
        
- **Level II: [[Conventional morality|Conventional]]**
    
    - **Stage 3:** **[[Interpersonal relationships|Interpersonal expectations]]** (“good person,” approval).
        
    - **Stage 4:** **[[Law-and-order orientation|Law & order]]** (duty; maintain social order).
        
- **Level III: [[Postconventional morality|Postconventional]]**
    
    - **Stage 5:** **[[Social contract orientation|Legal principles]]** (rights, fairness, democracy).
        
    - **Stage 6:** **[[Universal ethical principles]]** (self-chosen ethics; may supersede law).

## [[Emerging adulthood]]

~**Late teens → mid/late 20s** ([[Jeffrey Arnett|Arnett]]): exploration, instability, flexible roles; identity often unresolved until mid/late 20s. **Not universal**—common where adult roles are **postponed** (industrial/post-industrial societies). **[[Marriage]]** often delayed into late 20s/30s.

---

## Adulthood → [[Aging]]

- **Early adulthood (20s–30s):** peak [[Physical strength|physical strength]].
    
- **Middle adulthood (40s–mid-60s):** gradual decline in strength/endurance; slower [[Reaction time|reactions]].
    
- **Late adulthood (65+):** further declines in stamina/reaction time; loss of [[Lean body mass|lean muscle]], ↑ [[Body fat|body fat]], weaker [[Bone density|bones]]; **[[Cognitive aging|cognitive]]** changes vary.
    
- **Influences:** genetics + life experiences (**[[Epigenetics]]**).
    

### Hormonal & reproductive changes

Key shifts across adult years (e.g., [[Menopause]]/[[Andropause]] trajectories).

### Late adulthood & the brain

> **Key theme:** Late life does **not** necessarily bring steep global decline; targeted strategies can **boost** aging brains.

---

## [[Death and dying|Death & Dying]]

Frameworks for understanding the end of life; classic work by **[[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]]**.

---

## [[Parenting styles]] (raising psychologically healthy children)

Overview of basic styles and their developmental implications.
