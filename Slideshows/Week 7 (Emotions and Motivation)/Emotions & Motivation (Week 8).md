# Emotions & Motivation — Week 8

> **In this unit:** [[Motivation]] (intrinsic, extrinsic, [[Achievement motivation]]), classic [[Theories of motivation]] (instinct, drive-reduction, arousal, [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], [[Self-Determination Theory]]), [[Emotion]] vs [[Mood]], theories of emotion ([[James–Lange theory]], [[Cannon–Bard theory]], [[Schachter–Singer theory]], [[Cognitive appraisal theory|Lazarus]] & [[Zajonc]]), universality & culture (Darwin, [[Paul Ekman]]; [[Display rules]]), [[Facial feedback hypothesis]], and the [[Biology of fear]] ([[Amygdala]], fast/slow pathways).

## [[Motivation]]

### [[Extrinsic motivation]] vs [[Intrinsic motivation]]

- **Extrinsic:** doing a task **for** an external outcome (grades, pay, praise); [[Incentive|incentives]] motivate **only if** they’re believed instrumental to the [[Goal|goal]].
    
- **Intrinsic:** doing a task **for its own sake** ([[Interest|interest]], [[Enjoyment|enjoyment]], [[Curiosity|curiosity]]).
    
- **Development:** both forms emerge and interact across contexts ([[School]], [[Work]], [[Sport]]).
    

### [[Achievement motivation]]

- Proposed as a **third** type: a drive to meet a **standard of excellence** and compete against it.
    
- If you love **being the best** but not the steps, that may reflect **achievement** rather than pure intrinsic/extrinsic motives.

## [[Theories of motivation]]

### [[Instinct theory]]

- [[Instinct|Instincts]]: complex, unlearned, species-general patterns (e.g., hatchling sea turtles to the ocean).
    
- Largely **unsupported** as a full account of human motivation, but inspired the **[[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]]**.
    

### [[Drive-reduction theory]]

- Behavior aims to reduce **[[Need]]s** and restore **[[Homeostasis]]** (steady internal states).
    
- **[[Need]]** → **[[Drive]]** (tension) → behavior to reduce drive.
    

### [[Arousal theory]]

- We seek an **optimal level** of [[Arousal]] (varies by person).
    
- **[[Sensation seeking]]** typically rises through the teens, peaks ~**age 19**, then declines in the 20s.
    

### [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]

- Universal needs organized from **[[Physiological needs|physiological]] → [[Safety needs|safety]] → [[Love and belonging|love/belonging]] → [[Esteem needs|esteem]] → [[Self-actualization]] → [[Self-transcendence]]**.
    
- Ordering is **flexible**: higher goals can at times supersede lower ones (e.g., [[Fasting]] for religious meaning).
    

### [[Self-Determination Theory]] (Deci & Ryan)

- Three basic psychological needs drive optimal functioning:
    
    - **[[Competence]]:** mastery/progress on goals
        
    - **[[Relatedness]]:** close, meaningful relationships
        
    - **[[Autonomy]]:** self-endorsed action/choice

## [[Emotion]] vs [[Mood]]

- **Emotion:** brief, stimulus-initiated **psychological state** with **[[Subjective experience|subjective]]**, **[[Physiological arousal|physiological]]**, and **[[Behavior|behavioral]]** components; tends to **motivate action**.
    
- **Mood:** longer-lasting, lower-intensity [[Affect|affect]] without a clear onset/offset.

## Theories of [[Emotion]]

### Physiology-first: [[James–Lange theory]]

- **Stimulus → physiological/behavioral change → felt emotion**; posits distinct “physiological fingerprints” per emotion.
    
- **Critique:** patterns are not always unique or sufficient.
    

### Simultaneity: [[Cannon–Bard theory]]

- **Emotion, physiology, and behavior occur together** (parallel outputs from [[Brain|brain]]).
    

### Arousal + label: [[Schachter–Singer theory]]

- **Arousal** needs a **cognitive label** to become a specific emotion.
    
- **Critique:** emotion can occur with **minimal labeling** (subcortical routes).
    

### Appraisal-first: [[Cognitive appraisal theory]] (Lazarus) & [[Zajonc]]

- **Appraisal** of events → emotion; emotions aid **coping**.
    
- **Debate:** thinking and emotion are **bidirectional**; sometimes **affect precedes cognition** (Zajonc).

## Reading & Expressing Emotion

### Darwin → Universality; [[Paul Ekman]]’s findings

- Core [[Facial expression|facial expressions]] map to **[[Basic emotions]]** across cultures (replicated widely, incl. **[[Blindness|blind]]** children).
    
- [[Display rules]]: cultural guidelines for **when/how/where** to express emotion; learned early and vary within/between cultures.
    

### [[Facial feedback hypothesis]]

- **Expressing** an emotion (e.g., pen **between teeth** vs **lips**) can **shape** what we feel.
    

---

## [[Basic emotions]] & Affective Systems

- Widely shared categories include **[[Happiness]]**, **[[Sadness]]**, **[[Surprise]]/[[Fear]]**, **[[Disgust]]/[[Anger]]**; negative emotions are highly **salient/adaptive**.
    
- [[Affective neuroscience|Affective neuroscience personality model]] highlights core systems: **PLAYFULNESS, SEEKING, CARING, ANGER, FEAR, SADNESS** shaping development and behavior.

## [[Biology of fear]]

- The **[[Amygdala]]** is central to fear learning and expression.
    
- Dual routes from **[[Thalamus]]**:
    
    - **Fast/“low road”**: Thalamus → **Amygdala** (quick, crude).
        
    - **Slow/“high road”**: Thalamus → **[[Cerebral cortex|Cortex]]** → Amygdala (deliberate, detailed).
        
- System interfaces with **[[Sympathetic nervous system]]** and **[[Pituitary gland]]** to coordinate bodily responses.

> [!tip] Study weave  
> Link theories to **examples** you’ve felt: a [[Startle reflex|jump-scare]] (low road), [[Cognitive reappraisal|reappraising]] a text message tone (Lazarus), or [[Misattribution of arousal|misattributing arousal]] after [[Caffeine|caffeine]] (Schachter–Singer). Then connect to brain flow from [[Neuroscience & Behavior — Chapter 2|Neuroscience]]: [[Thalamus]] ↔ [[Amygdala]] ↔ [[Cortex]].
