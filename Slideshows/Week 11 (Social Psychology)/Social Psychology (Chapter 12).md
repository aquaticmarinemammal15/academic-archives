## [[What is social psychology?]]

- The study of how **thoughts, feelings, behaviors** are influenced by **others** and by the **social/physical environment**. Compare with [[Sociology]] (focus on **groups & institutions**).
    

---

## Key research areas

- **[[Social cognition]]**: how we make sense of our social world
    
    - [[Person perception]] • [[Social categorization]] (explicit/implicit) • [[Implicit personality theory]] • [[Attribution]] • [[Attitude]]s • [[Stereotype]]s
        
- **[[Social influence]]**: how others & situations shape behavior.
    

---

## [[Person perception]] & [[Social categorization]]

- We use **mental shortcuts** ([[Schema|schemas]]) to form impressions.
    
- **[[Explicit cognition]]** (conscious) vs **[[Implicit cognition]]** (automatic).
    
- **[[Attractiveness heuristic]]** & other appearance cues can bias judgments.
    
- **[[Ingroup bias]]**: we favor “us.” Example finding: people **downrank closeness to a stranger** (vs a friend) who wronged them; neural data mirror this **ingroup leniency**.
    

---

## [[Attribution]]: explaining behavior

- **[[Fundamental attribution error|Fundamental attribution error (FAE)]]:** over-attribute others’ behavior to **dispositions**, underweight **situations** (stronger in **[[Individualism|individualistic]]** cultures).
    
- **[[Blaming the victim]]**: assign responsibility to victims; fueled by **[[Hindsight bias|hindsight]]** and **[[Just-world hypothesis]]**.
    
- **[[Self-serving bias]]** (individualistic): success = **me**, failure = **situation**.
    
- **[[Self-effacing bias]]** (collectivistic): success = **situation/others**, failure = **me**.
    
- **[[Social roles]]** can powerfully shape behavior (e.g., **[[Stanford prison experiment]]** paradigm).
    

---

## [[Attitude]]s & [[Cognitive dissonance]]

- **Attitude:** learned tendency to evaluate people/objects/issues.
    
- **[[Cognitive dissonance|Dissonance]]:** discomfort from mismatch of **attitude ↔ behavior** → reduce by **[[Justification|justifying]]** the act or **changing** the attitude (e.g., [[Post-decision dissonance|post-purchase rationalization]], “this deal was too good to pass up”).
    

---

## [[Prejudice]] & [[Stereotype]]s

- **Prejudice:** negative attitude toward a group.
    
- **Stereotypes:** attribute the **same traits** to all group members; simplify but mislead; persist via **[[Subtyping (stereotypes)|exception-making]]** and **[[Confirmation bias|confirmation]]**.
    
- **[[Stereotype threat]]:** fear of confirming a stereotype can **impair performance**.
    
- **Drivers:** competition for **scarce resources**, **social change**, perceived **threats** to [[Ingroup|ingroup]] norms/values.
    
- **Reducing prejudice:** **[[Superordinate goals]]** & **[[Cooperation]]**.
    
    - **[[Robbers Cave experiment|Robbers Cave]]**: rivalry → cooperation to restore harmony.
        
    - **[[Jigsaw classroom|Jigsaw classrooms]]**: interdependence ↑ self-esteem and **cross-ethnic liking**.
        

---

## [[Conformity]] (Asch)

- With line-length judgments, **76%** conformed at least once; ~**37%** of critical trials showed conformity; ~**2/3** of the time, participants resisted.
    
- Influences: [[Group size|group size]]/[[Unanimity|unanimity]], [[Ambiguity effect|ambiguity]], [[Culture|culture]], desire for [[Social approval|approval]].
    

---

## [[Obedience]] (Milgram)

- Participants delivered shocks up to **450 V** under authority prompts; obedience shaped by:
    
    - **[[Authority|Context & authority frame]]**, **[[Foot-in-the-door technique|gradual escalation]]**, **experimenter reassurances**, **[[Physical distance|separation]]** from learner, belief shocks were real.
        
- **Defiance** ↑ when seeing others disobey or when **choosing one’s own level** (most stop ≤150 V).
    

---

## [[Prosocial behavior]] & [[Altruism]]

- **Prosocial**: any helping, whether selfless or self-serving. **Altruism**: helping **without** expected reward.
    
- Helping more likely when: positive mood, **[[Guilt]]**, seeing others help, believing the person **deserves** help, **knowing how** to help, **personalized** connection, or **[[Dangerous world belief|dangerous]]** context.
    
- Classic **[[Bystander effect|bystander]]** inhibitors: [[Diffusion of responsibility]], [[Evaluation apprehension]], [[Pluralistic ignorance]].
    

---

## [[Aggression]]

- **Definition:** behavior intended to **harm** someone who doesn’t want harm.
    
- **Biology/biochem:** [[Testosterone]] links are **weak**, [[Alcohol]] **elevates** risk/severity.
    
- **Gender:** males show more **direct/physical** aggression; females comparable in **indirect/[[Relational aggression|relational]]** forms.
    
- **Culture:** **[[Culture of honor]]** (e.g., U.S. South/parts of Latin America) & [[Income inequality]] correlate with higher violence.
    

---

## Groups → Behavior

- **[[Social loafing]]:** less effort in groups when individual input is hard to see; reduced when members **know** each other, value the group, or find tasks **meaningful**; in many **[[Collectivism|collectivistic]]** cultures, **[[Social striving]]** (more effort in groups) appears instead.
    
- **[[Social facilitation]]:** presence of others **enhances** well-learned/easy tasks, **impairs** difficult/new tasks.
    
- **[[Deindividuation]]:** lowered self-awareness/inhibition in crowds → [[Vandalism]], [[Cyberbullying|online trolling/cyberbullying]]; countered by **heightening [[Self-awareness]]**.
