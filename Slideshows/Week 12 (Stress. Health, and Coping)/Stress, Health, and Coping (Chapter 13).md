# Stress, Health, and Coping — Overview

> **Key theme:** When events are perceived as **exceeding your ability to cope**, you experience the unpleasant emotional and physical state called **[[Stress]]**.

## [[Stress]]: What it is & where it comes from

### Major sources

- **[[Life events]] & [[Change|change]]** ([[Life-events approach|life-events approach]]).
    
- **[[Traumatic event|Traumatic events]].**
    
- **[[Daily hassles]]:** most common = **[[Interpersonal conflict]]** for men **and** women.
    
    - **Women:** more friend/family-related hassles; [[Spillover effect|spillover]] to partner interactions.
        
    - **Men:** more [[School]]/[[Work]] hassles; [[Withdrawal (psychology)|withdrawal]] more likely.
        
    - **Both:** [[School]]/[[Work]] stress affects [[Family|home life]].
        
- **[[Occupational stress|Work stress]] & [[Burnout]].**
    
- **[[Social stress|Social sources of stress]].**

## [[Mind–body connection]]

> **Key theme:** [[Stress]] affects physical health via the **[[Endocrine system]]**, the **[[Immune system]]**, and even **[[Chromosome]]s**.

### Classic models & systems

- [[Walter Cannon]]: **[[Fight-or-flight response]]** — rapid physiological chain preparing for **fight** or **flight** to immediate threat.
    
- [[Hans Selye]]: **[[General Adaptation Syndrome]] (GAS)** (rat studies):
    
    - **Findings:** enlarged **[[Adrenal gland|adrenals]]**, **[[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]]/[[Weight loss|weight loss]]**, and shrinkage of **[[Thymus]]/[[Lymph node|lymph glands]]** (key immune components).
        
- **[[Endocrine system]]:** [[Stress hormone|stress hormones]] mobilize energy and modulate other systems.
    
- **[[Immune system]]:** produces **[[Lymphocyte|lymphocytes]]** (specialized white blood cells) that fight [[Virus|viruses]]/[[Bacteria|bacteria]]/[[Tumor|tumor]] cells. [[Stressor]]s (major or common) can **reduce immune function**.
    

#### Stress & infection

- **[[Sheldon Cohen|Cohen]] cold studies:** higher chronic stress → **greater susceptibility** to the common cold after exposure (linked to [[Corticosteroid|corticosteroid]] activity).
    
    - Not all stress is suppressive: **short-term stress may enhance** immunity; health reflects **multiple factors** and **individual differences** in vulnerability.

## Individual factors that shape stress responses

> **Key theme:** Several **psychological factors** modify responses to stress and influence health.

### [[Perceived control]] / personal control

- Having control over a stressor **reduces distress/arousal**; perceptions must be **[[Accuracy (psychology)|realistic]]** to help.
    
- **Cultural note:** personal control is especially valued in **[[Individualism|individualistic]]** cultures.
    
- **[[Judith Rodin|Rodin]] et al.:** nursing-home residents given **more choices** were **more active, alert, and healthier** than those with less control.
    

### [[Optimism]] vs [[Pessimism]]; [[Negative affect|chronic negative emotion]]

- [[Explanatory style]] and chronic negative affect relate to stress vulnerability and health.
    

### [[Type A]] pattern & **[[Hostility]]**

- **[[Type A]]**: time urgency + **hostility/anger** → associated with **[[Coronary heart disease|heart disease]]** and greater **[[Blood pressure|BP]]/[[Heart rate|HR]]** reactivity.
    
- **[[Type B]]**: more easygoing/relaxed; **not** linked to heart disease.
    
- Caution: many findings are **[[Correlation|correlational]]**; personality may affect health **indirectly** (via [[Health behavior|habits]]), and **[[Illness behavior|disease can influence emotion]]**.

## [[Social support]]: a powerful buffer

> **Key theme:** **[[Social support]]** = resources provided by others. Low support predicts **worse** outcomes.

- **Low support / [[Social isolation|isolation]]** → ~**2×** [[Mortality risk|mortality risk]] vs robust relationships; chronic [[Loneliness]] predicts poorer physical/mental health, higher death rates, **decreased [[Cognitive functioning|cognitive functioning]]**.
    
- **[[Social network|Diverse social networks]]** benefit health; there are **[[Sex differences|gender differences]]** in seeking/using support.
    

**Helpful strategies (for supporters):** [[Active listening|listen well]]; invite feelings; show [[Affection]]/[[Empathy|understanding]]; **invest time/attention**.  
**Unhelpful strategies:** (implied) minimizing, criticizing, or [[Controlling behavior|controlling]] the stressed person.

---

## [[Coping]]: how people deal with stress

> **Definition:** efforts to **change circumstances** or **reframe interpretations** to make them **less threatening**.

- **[[Adaptive behavior|Adaptive]] vs [[Maladaptive behavior|maladaptive]] coping** (e.g., constructive [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] vs [[Withdrawal (psychology)|withdrawal]]/[[Rumination]]/[[Substance misuse|substance misuse]]).
    
- **[[Stress management|Minimizing the effects of stress]]**: build [[Perceived control|control]] where possible, use [[Social support|support networks]], and select [[Coping strategy|coping strategies]] that fit the situation.
