# Psychological Disorders — Overview

> **Key themes:** [[Psychopathology]] studies the **[[Origins|origins]]**, **[[Symptom|symptoms]]**, and **[[Development|development]]** of disorders, whose boundaries are shaped by **social/cultural [[Context|context]]**. [[Diagnosis]] organizes **patterns** of [[Distress|distress]]/[[Functional impairment|impairment]]; treatment spans **[[Psychotherapy]]** and **[[Biomedical therapy|biomedical]]** approaches.

## [[Psychopathology|What is psychopathology?]]

- **[[Psychological disorder|Psychological (mental) disorder]]:** **pattern** of behavioral/psychological symptoms that cause **significant [[Distress|distress]]** and/or **[[Functional impairment|impairment]]** in important life areas.
    
- “Normal vs abnormal” often reflects **prevailing [[Social norms|norms]]**; [[Stigma]] persists; most with disorders are **not [[Violence|violent]]** (risk ↑ mainly with **severe** symptoms).
    

---

## [[DSM-5]]

- **[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.)]]**: symptoms, decision rules, typical course; **260+** disorders.
    
- **Critiques:** “everyday” conditions medicalized; **arbitrary cutoffs**; possible **gender bias**; conflicts of interest; alternatives include **[[ICD]]**, **[[RDoC]]**, and transdiagnostic “**[[P factor]]**” directions.

## [[Anxiety]], [[PTSD]], and [[OCD]]

> **Core idea:** when anxiety is **irrational**, **uncontrollable**, and **disruptive**, it defines a disorder.

### [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]] (GAD)

- **Excessive, global, persistent** worry; when one worry fades, another replaces it.
    
- Risk shaped by **[[Biological factors|biological]]**, **[[Psychological factors|psychological]]**, and **early [[Stress|stress]]** factors (e.g., [[Early life stress]]).
    

### [[Panic disorder]] & [[Panic attack]]

- Sudden episodes of **intense fear** with strong bodily symptoms; may become fear of **having more attacks**. Explanations include [[Biological preparedness|biological sensitivity]] + [[Cognitive model|cognitive processes]].
    

### [[Phobia]]s

- **Specific phobia:** intense, irrational fear; ~**12%** lifetime; ~**2×** more common in **women**.
    
- Four broad categories: **situations**, **natural environment**, **injury/blood** ([[Blood–injury–injection phobia]]), **animals/insects** ([[Animal phobia]]).
    
- [[Social anxiety disorder]]: fear of **negative evaluation**; cultural variants (e.g., **[[Taijin kyōfushō]]**).
    
- **Origins:** [[Classical conditioning]], [[Operant conditioning]], [[Observational learning]], plus **[[Preparedness (learning)|biological preparedness]]** for ancestral threats.
    

### [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD)

- Triggered by **[[Trauma]]**; clusters: **[[Intrusion (PTSD)|intrusions]]**, **[[Avoidance (psychology)|avoidance]]**, **[[Negative affect|negative mood]]/[[Cognition|cognitions]]**, **[[Hyperarousal|hyperarousal]]**.
    

### [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD)

- **[[Obsessions]]** (intrusive thoughts) + **[[Compulsions]]** (repetitive acts/mental rituals to reduce distress). Multiple explanatory models (learning, cognitive, biological).

- **Prevalence/course:** ~**15%** lifetime US; ~**20M** U.S. adults, **300M** worldwide affected; **women ≈2× men** (underreport in men likely). [[Cross-cultural]] presence with linguistic framing differences. [[Relapse]] risk significant.
    

### [[Bipolar disorder]]

- Swings between **incapacitating depression** and **[[Mania|mania]]** ([[Euphoria|euphoria]], energy, rapid thought/speech → [[Flight of ideas]]).
    
- **Course:** often begins **early 20s**; episodes **days–months**; recurs; some **[[Rapid cycling]]**; **no gender difference**; commonly controlled with **[[Lithium (medication)|lithium]]**.
    
- **[[Cyclothymic disorder]]:** chronic, **milder** mood swings ≥ **2 years**.
    
- **Etiology:** [[Genetics|genetics]], [[Brain structure|brain structure]]/[[Neurochemistry|chemistry]], [[Stress|stress]]; [[Smoking]] linked to MDD risk.
    

---

## [[Eating disorder]]s

- Severe disturbances in eating ([[Restriction|restriction]], [[Binge eating|bingeing]], [[Purging|purging]]) and **body-weight/shape** concerns ([[Body image]]).
    
- **90–95%** female; contributors include **[[Serotonin]]** differences, **[[Genetic risk|genetic]]** risk, **[[Family dynamics]]**, **critical comments**, cultural **thinness** ideals, **[[Perfectionism]]**, [[Negative self-schema|negative self-beliefs]].
    

---

## [[Personality disorder]]s

- **Inflexible, maladaptive, pervasive** patterns; stable over time/situations; ~**10%** [[Prevalence|population]]; DSM-5 clusters: **[[Cluster A personality disorders|odd/eccentric]]**, **[[Cluster B personality disorders|dramatic/erratic]]**, **[[Cluster C personality disorders|anxious/fearful]]**.
    

### [[Antisocial personality disorder]]

- Pattern of disregard for/violation of others’ rights (details in lecture).
    

### [[Borderline personality disorder]] (BPD)

- **Instability** in relationships, self-image, and emotion; **[[Impulsivity]]**, intense [[Anger|anger]]; fear of **[[Abandonment]]**; **[[Self-harm]]** and **suicide** attempts (≈**10%** die by suicide).
    
- **[[Biosocial model]]:** emotional vulnerability + [[Invalidating environment|invalidating environments]]; [[Trauma]] common but **not required**.
    

---

## [[Dissociative disorder]]s

- **Disruptions** in [[Awareness|awareness]], [[Memory|memory]], [[Identity|identity]] impair functioning.
    
- **[[Dissociative amnesia]]** (± **[[Dissociative fugue|fugue]]**).
    
- **[[Dissociative identity disorder]] (DID):** ≥**2** identity states + [[Amnesia|amnesia]]; etiology debated; many report severe childhood **[[Abuse]]**; dissociative coping theory contested and difficult to test.

## [[Schizophrenia]]

> Among the most serious disorders—distortions in **[[Belief|beliefs]]**, **[[Perception|perception]]**, and **[[Thought disorder|thought]]**.

- **Dx:** ≥**2** characteristic symptoms active ≥**1 month** (longer overall course). See [[Diagnostic criteria]].
    
- **Positive symptoms:** [[Delusion]]s, [[Hallucination]]s, **[[Disorganized speech]]**/behavior.
    
- **Negative symptoms:** diminished expression ([[Flat affect]]), [[Apathy]], [[Avolition]].
    
- **Prevalence:** ~**1M** Americans treated yearly; **21M** worldwide; found **globally**; content of delusions varies with **[[Culture]]/**time (e.g., tech/media themes).
    
- **Course:** onset **[[Young adulthood|young adulthood]]**; ~**¼** full recovery; ~**¼** recurrent with minimal impairment; ~**½** [[Chronic illness|chronic]]/**severe**.
    
- **Etiology:** strong **[[Genetic contribution|genetic]]** contribution ([[Polygenic]]; [[Neurodevelopment|neurodevelopmental]] genes); **prenatal/early** infections (e.g., [[Influenza|flu]] exposure; [[Season-of-birth effect|winter/spring birth]]) ↑ risk; **[[Brain structure|brain structure]]** and **[[Neurochemistry|neurochemistry]]** differences ([[Dopamine]] ↑ activity; [[Glutamate]]/[[Adenosine]] implicated). **[[Antipsychotic]]s** reduce dopamine activity; [[Dopamine agonist|dopamine agonists]] can **worsen** symptoms.

## Treatment: [[Psychotherapy]] & [[Biomedical therapy|Biomedical Approaches]]

### [[Psychotherapy]]

- **Works:** average treated client does better than ~**80%** of untreated; gains often **endure**; [[Neuroimaging|brain changes]] can resemble medication effects.
    
- **Approaches:**
    
    - **[[Psychoanalysis]]:** [[Free association|free association]], **[[Transference]]**; uncover conflicts/defenses.
        
    - **[[Behavior therapy]]:** change behavior via [[Classical conditioning]], [[Operant conditioning]], [[Observational learning]].
        
    - **[[Cognitive therapy]]:** target **maladaptive thoughts**.
        
    - **[[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT):** pragmatic blend; **[[Transdiagnostic]]**, effective across ages/cultures/delivery modes.
        
    - **[[Group therapy]]:** cost-effective, real-time social practice/support.
        
    - **[[Family therapy]]:** treats family as **[[Systems theory|system]]**; often boosts individual outcomes.
        
- **What works best?** Some targeted matches (e.g., **[[Cognitive therapy|cognitive]]/[[Interpersonal therapy|IPT]]** for MDD; **cognitive/CBT/behavior** for [[Panic disorder|panic]]/[[OCD]]/[[Phobia]]). For **severe [[Psychosis|psychosis]]**, [[Insight therapy|insight-only]] therapies underperform. Overall, **multiple** empirically supported options show **similar** outcomes.
    
- **Common factors:** strong **[[Therapeutic alliance]]**, [[Cultural competence|culturally responsive]] care, therapist [[Clinical competence|competencies]].
    

### [[Biomedical therapy]]

- **[[Psychotropic medication|Psychotropic medications]]:** alter mental functions; often combined with therapy.
    
- **[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT):** highly effective short-term option for **severe [[Major depressive disorder|MDD]]** (~**80%** improve); modern ECT has **low complication** rates; induces brief, controlled [[Seizure]].
