# Personality — Overview

> **In this chapter:** [[What is personality?]], [[Psychoanalytic perspective]] (id/ego/superego, [[Defense mechanism]]s, [[Psychosexual stages|psychosexual stages]]), [[Neo-Freudians]] (Jung, Horney), [[Social-cognitive perspective]] (Bandura, [[Self-efficacy]], [[Reciprocal determinism]]), [[Trait perspective]] (Allport, Cattell, Eysenck, [[Big Five]]), [[Behavioral genetics|neuroscience & genetics]], animals and personality, and [[Assessing personality]] (projective tests, self-report, [[MBTI]] caveats).

## [[What is personality?]]

- **Definition:** an individual’s **unique** and **relatively consistent** patterns of **[[Thinking|thinking]]**, **[[Emotion|feeling]]**, and **[[Behavior|behaving]]**.
    

---

## [[Psychoanalytic perspective]]

**Key theme:** behavior is shaped by **[[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]** forces, **[[Instinct|sexual & aggressive]]** instincts, and **[[Early childhood|early childhood]]** experiences.

### Levels & structure of personality

- **[[Id]]** — _completely unconscious_, irrational; seeks immediate satisfaction; **[[Pleasure principle]]**.
    
- **[[Ego]]** — partly conscious, rational regulator; mediates among demands; **[[Reality principle]]**.
    
- **[[Superego]]** — partly conscious moral system; internalized parental/societal rules; evaluates thoughts/acts.
    

### [[Defense mechanism]]s (ego tools)

Unconscious strategies that reduce anxiety by **distorting** reality (e.g., [[Repression]], [[Denial]], [[Projection]], [[Displacement]], [[Rationalization]], [[Reaction formation]], [[Sublimation]]).

### Psychosexual stages & [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]]

Age-related stages with different **erogenous focuses**; unresolved conflicts can → **fixation**.  
Includes [[Oedipus complex]] dynamics (early childhood) and later **[[Latency period|latency]]/**[[Adolescence|adolescence]] phases.

---

## [[Neo-Freudians]]

Followed Freud on the **unconscious/early experience**, but **diverged** in key ways.

- **[[Carl Jung]]** — [[Collective unconscious]] with **[[Archetype|archetypes]]**.
    
- **[[Karen Horney]]** — emphasized **[[Culture]]/[[Relationships|relationships]]** (esp. parent–child) and **[[Basic anxiety]]**; critiqued “penis envy,” proposed **[[Womb envy]]**; argued many problems reflect **relationship disturbances** more than sexual conflicts.
    

---

## [[Social-cognitive perspective]]

**Key theme:** personality reflects **[[Consciousness|conscious]]** processes, **[[Self-regulation]]**, and **[[Situation|situational]]** influences.

- **[[Albert Bandura]]** — **[[Social cognitive theory]]**:
    
    - **[[Observational learning]]**, cognitive processes, social experiences.
        
    - **[[Self-efficacy]]:** beliefs about one’s capability in specific situations.
        
    - **[[Reciprocal determinism]]:** behavior, cognition, and environment **interact** bidirectionally.
        

---

## [[Trait perspective]]

**Key theme:** identify, describe, and **measure** individual differences.

- **[[Gordon Allport]]** — early catalog of ~4,000 descriptors.
    
- **[[Raymond Cattell]]** — [[16PF|16 Personality Factors]] via [[Factor analysis]] (reduced trait list).
    
- **[[Hans Eysenck]]** — broad dimensions (e.g., [[Extraversion–introversion|extraversion–introversion]], [[Neuroticism]]).</br>
    

### [[Big Five]] (OCEAN)

**[[Openness]], [[Conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion]], [[Agreeableness]], [[Neuroticism]]** — widely supported five-factor structure; handy acronym **[[OCEAN]]**.

- **Stability & change:** traits are **relatively stable** across situations; some show **lifespan trends** (e.g., ↑ [[Conscientiousness]]/[[Extraversion]]; ↓ [[Neuroticism]] linked to better [[Career outcomes|career outcomes]]).
    

### Brains & traits

[[Neuroimaging]] links:

- High **[[Extraversion]]** → stronger responses to **positive** images.
    
- High **[[Neuroticism]]** → stronger responses to **negative** images.  
    Associations reported for other Big Five dimensions as well.
    

### Genes, species, and traits

- **[[Behavioral genetics]]:** estimates [[Heritability|heritability]] of traits alongside environmental effects.
    
- **Do animals have personality?** Yes—trait-like clusters observed in **200+ species**; meet criteria of clustering, **temporal stability**, and **between-individual** variation (even fun work like “Big Five for **[[Cat|cats]]**”). See [[Animal personality]].
    

---

## [[Assessing personality]]

Two broad families: **[[Projective test|projective]]** vs **[[Self-report inventory|self-report]]** measures.

### [[Projective test]]s

- **[[Rorschach test]]** — inkblots to probe unconscious content; **[[Validity (psychometrics)|validity]]/**[[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] concerns.
    
- **[[Thematic Apperception Test|TAT]]** — make up stories to ambiguous scenes; rich narratives but **[[Subjectivity|subjective]]** scoring.
    

### Self-report inventories

- Objectively scored against **[[Standardization|standardized norms]]**; paper-and-pencil or digital formats; direct questions/ratings.
    
- Examples: **[[MMPI]]**, **[[CPI]]**.
    

### [[MBTI]] (Myers–Briggs Type Indicator)

- Classifies into **16 types** (preferences for processing info, deciding, interacting).
    
- **Limitations:** weak evidence for discrete **types**, issues with **[[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]]/[[Validity (psychometrics)|validity]]**, and concerns about **[[Career assessment|career]]** use/predictions. Prefer **[[Trait measure|trait]]** measures for precision.
